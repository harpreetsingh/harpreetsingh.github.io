Long Bio
---

 Childhood in India: Born in New Delhi, brought up in Mumbai, my
 bachelors in Pune. Early years in SE Asia: Spent considerable time in
 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and love SE Asia.  Did my graduate studies in
 University of Cincinnati, Ohio and moved to the San Francisco Bay
 Area and consider myself a Californian at heart :-)

 I consider myself a product of Maharashtra (Mumbai/Pune understanding
 of Hindi/Marathi/Gujrati), Punjabi, Malaysia (very very minor :-)) and
 California.

I am a student at heart
----

 BE in Computer Engineering (PICT, Univ of Pune), MS in Computer
 Science (Univ of Cincinnati) and MBA (Santa Clara University
 - <b>minor in Finance</b>). I strongly believe that everyone is a
 life-long student. I get turned off by know-it-alls and Guru's out
 there.

Passionate about Technology
---

Technology drives me - surprise that I am in the bay area! I joined
Sun Microsystems in the Java Division in the early days of the J2EE
division (or as I now call it when Sun was the Google of Tech
industry). I like working with super smart and unpretentious people.

These days, I have moved out of programming to worrying about making
money from technology.

Build world class products
----

I thrive in building world class products that win the market. I used
to be in GlassFish (an AppServer from Sun) and now at CloudBees I run
the product management division that helps set vision for Jenkins in
OSS and CloudBees products.

Live in various domains
---

I run Product Management and Evangelism; have run Marketing, Product
Marketing, Solution Engineering; done sales calls, testing, wrote
documentation, analyst calls, wrote white papers, blogs, set up
conferences from scratch, presented at conferences - both in technical
conferences and business conferences.

I love wearing these multiple hats and focusing on the <b>right</b>
big picture and then driving things to successful conclusions :-)

I do other things too
---

I prefer to read, watch movies, take my dog out for walks and paint in
my spare time. Passionate about meditation - have done it close to 16
years now.

<p>Drop me a line - I love hearing from people</p>

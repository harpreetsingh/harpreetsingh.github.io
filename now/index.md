Jenkins and CloudBees
----
I have spent the last 5 years at CloudBees working with really smart
people building a business on Jenkins.


I have played my part releasing Jenkins 2.0 and Jenkins Pipelines. I
have also played my part building out the CloudBees Jenkins Platform
and lately Jenkins-as-a-Service product called CJP Private SaaS
Edition.

<h3>Painting</h3>

I discovered Bob Ross and the joys of painting. I have been on a
painting spree having re-kindled my love for oils. I will post some
that I have painted recently.

# The Power of Suggestion <a name="Suggestion"></a>
In this chapter Claude talks about the power of repetition and suggestion.

A task begun with the belief that it is achievable is achieved. This belief is often achieved by using the power of suggestion. Thus, employ any number of techniques that consistently remind you of this belief. An example here is to use talismans such as "clover leaf" or an amulet that captures your belief.

 Personally, I equate these suggestions to mission statements in companies or in our private lives. The purpose of the statement (if done well) is to act as a north star that aligns every activity.


# The Art of Mental Pictures <a name="Pictures"></a>
In this chapter Claude talks about the power of pictures. He makes a case the focussed, directed imagination unleashes forces within and without to help us achieve our goals. He makes a case that imagination is not "wishful thinking" and day-dreaming and these don't have the power to release latent forces required for achievement.

The process requires us to fix our thoughts and imagination steadily on our goals. Most people cannot concentrate for a length of time and this skill is  must-have for the pictures to work.

This is where he diverges from all new-age mantra book who ask you to put your thoughts out there and see them manifest. He asks us to clearly visualise on our goals and completely focus on them.

     years, first 10 years as an engineer and the last 10 in product
     management. I have been fortunate to work at great companies - at
     Java division in Sun Microsystems, <a href="https://www.persistent.com/">Persistent Systems</a> in India
     and now at <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a>.

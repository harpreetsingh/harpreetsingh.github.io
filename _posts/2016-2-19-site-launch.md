Well. Doing my personal blog again...last I did it was at Sun Microsystems maybe 10 years ago. 

Blogging was hip and the in-thing to do at Sun and I don't think I had much to say apart from my technical blogs. This time around, blogging is no longer hip and I do think I have something to say. More importantly, I want to use blogs to capture my thoughts and keep a record of things that I learn and hopefully share something in return.

I was convinced to do my blogs by seeing posts by Scott Hanselman, Derek Sivers and reading the "Show your work" book.
